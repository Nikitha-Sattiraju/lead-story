        <p> Tens of thousands of children in the country continue to test positive for unsafe blood lead levels. However, CDC data on childhood lead poisoning is an underrepresentation of the extent to which American children are affected. At
          present, CDC only funds 35 state and local programs to report the number of children that tested positive for high lead levels in their blood. The remaining states may volunteer the information should their state health programs choose to
          but are not required to do so. As a result, there is no data on childhood lead poisoning for several states as shown in the map below. The latest available data is only until 2016.</p>

          <p>According to a study by the the Public Health Institute's California Environmental Health Tracking Program, the number of children with elevated blood lead levels between 1999-2010 was 1.2 million, which is double what the CDC reported.
            Lead poisoning, even at low levels, can have serious implications for childhood development. It can affect children's IQ, behaviour as well as hearing. However, parents often have a hard time linking these symptoms to lead poisoning and
            therefore don't get their children tested, according to Jill Samuels, program administrator, the lead poisoning prevention and treatment program at the children's hospital at Montefiore, New York City. As a result, many children are not
            tested or treated.</p>
